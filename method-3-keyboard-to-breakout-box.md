## Keyboard to Breakout Box

### There are KVM Boxes:

* KMD-3		https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=36702.0
* Reuters Breakout Box

### TODO: title for this

* User Anfauglir (Jaws of Thirst) had access to a Reuters Breakout Box
* Here: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Key_Mou_Pad/M.1499538853.A.F7F.html
* This keyboard requires a 12V power supply to operate and can be supplied from
the DB-15 HOST connector. (I don't know which pins)
* The Desk PC / WkSt port on the keyboard can be directly connected to the computer with DB9 to PS/2 cable. 
* DB9 -> PS/2 PIN pin corresponds to:
    * 1-> 4,
    * 7-> 3,
    * 8-> 1,
    * 9-> 5.  
* Special keys are basically un-responsive. 
* Scrn1/2/3/4 keys have a light but he cannot determine how to use them. 
* There is no Windows (Command) Key on the keyboard. (Currently in the macOS will be specified to 
the Command Command, Caps Lock assigned to Option) 
* It is said to have NKRO, unconfirmed.

### Connections

* Serial communications takes place across both connectors. The host can assert control at any time. 
* Breakout box.



### TODO: Pros cons unknowns

### Unknowns:

* Are the DB-9 and DB-15 cables from keyboard to Breakout Box straight through?
* What pins on the DB-15 are used for 12v?

### Connectors:

I have one [G80-9009] currently in use (with original setup, kmd3 box).

You need to use a 12v 500mA adapter which converts to 15-pin D connector (I have
an original adapter so I don't know what the pins are), and a cable from 9-pin D
connector to PS/2. If anyone of you have this keyboard and interested I may
write a documentation on this keyboard.

The kmd3 or adapter box is not necessary. But if you have one, you can switch
keyboard and mouse input between 2 computers on the keyboard.ï»¿

### Videos

* Using kmd3. Quick demo, types on computer. Includes Set-up and macro definition. 
Cherry G80-9039HAAUS / Reuters AK124. 2 cables coming off the rear: 
    a) 15? pin D connector to another 15 pin D, attached to the keyboard at 
    about the F5 and F6 key area. Also joining that second D connecter is a thick, black cable
    coming from a black "brick". (Power supply??) Labeled with a paper sticker saying 
    "REUTERS EQUIPMENT." This seems likely where the keyboard is being powered from.
    b) Thin cable DB-9 likely, adjacent to 1st cable. Enters the keyboard at approximately
    the F20 key location.
