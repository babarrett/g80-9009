### Keyboard to Breakout Box, Modification #3

* User Anfauglir (Jaws of Thirst) had access to a Reuters Breakout Box
* Here: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Key_Mou_Pad/M.1499538853.A.F7F.html
* This keyboard requires a 12V power supply to operate and can be supplied from
the DB-15 HOST connector. (I don't know which pins)
* The Desk PC / WkSt port on the keyboard can be directly connected to the computer with DB9 to PS/2 cable. 
* DB9 -> PS/2 PIN pin corresponds to:
    * 1-> 4,
    * 7-> 3,
    * 8-> 1,
    * 9-> 5.  
* Special keys are basically un-responsive. 
* Scrn1/2/3/4 keys have a light but he cannot determine how to use them. 
* There is no Windows (Command) Key on the keyboard. (Currently in the macOS will be specified to 
the Command Command, Caps Lock assigned to Option) 
* It is said to have NKRO, unconfirmed.

Unknowns:

* Are the DB-9 and DB-15 cables from keyboard to Breakout Box straight through?
* What pins on the DB-15 are used for 12v?
