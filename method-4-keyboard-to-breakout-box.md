## Keyboard to Breakout Box

![The configuration](../master/images/Cherry%20G80-9009%20KVM.png "KVM connect diagram")

### There are two "KVM" Boxes:

* KMD-3		https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=36702.0
* Reuters Breakout Box

### What it is:

* User Anfauglir (Jaws of Thirst) had access to a Reuters Breakout Box
* Here: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Key_Mou_Pad/M.1499538853.A.F7F.html
* This keyboard requires a 12V power supply to operate and can be supplied from
the DB-15 HOST connector.
* The usual configuration is: 
    - The Keyboard Desk PC/WorkStation port to KVM
    - The "Host" port to KVM
    - The desktop mouse (PS/2) to the KVM
    - The rest of the connections go from the KVM to the Keyboard, and
    Mouse connectors on the (multiple) attached computers.
* The output keyboard ports on the KVM can be connected, via adapters, to the
(multiple) attached computers.
* DB9 -> PS/2 adapter pinout is: 
    * 1-> 4,
    * 7-> 3,
    * 8-> 1,
    * 9-> 5.  
    See [Making Cables](../master/making-cables.md "Cable making instructions")
* Special keys are totally available. 
* Scrn1/2/3/4 keys may be usable. I don't know how yet.

### Pros:
* Everything works as designed, once you convert the serial keyboard out port(s)
of the KVM to PS/2, and from there to USB, if needed.
* Simple solution in terms of hardware, if you can locate the boxes and cables. 
    - Do not have to open the keyboard
    - No special controller needed
    - Power-supply likely included with the KVM so you don't have to make one
* The built in functions, display commands (on the fly macro creation,
calculator) still work.
* The keyboard and mouse switching would work, so you get a 2 or 3
station KVM "for free."

### Cons:

* Almost impossible to find the breakout boxes, and if you do it's likely you
won't find the right cables. (There also seems to be no documentation on the
cable pinouts)
* You have to create a custom cable, which shouldn't be too bad.
* You'll need another converter if you want to get from PS/2 to USB. 
* You'll have to use a Soarer (or similar?) converter if you want to get to USB and have a programmable keyboard.

### Unknowns:

* The inside og the breakout box is **very** simple. One 5V regulator, one 
Hex inverter, a simple PCB, and all the connectors.

The Breakout Box only contains 2 ICs:
    * L7805CV - 5V regulator
    * SN7496 Hex inverter - These TTL hex inverter buffers/drivers feature
    high-voltage open-collector outputs for interfacing with high-level circuits
    (such as MOS) or for driving high-current loads (such as lamps or relays), and
    also are characterized for use as inverter buffers for driving TTL inputs. The
    SN7406 has a minimum breakdown voltage of 30 V. The maximum sink current is 
    40 mA for the SN7406s.

I have one [G80-9009] currently in use (with original setup, kmd3 box).

You need to use a 12v 500mA adapter which converts to 15-pin D connector (I have
an original adapter so I don't know what the pins are), and a cable from 9-pin D
connector to PS/2. If anyone of you have this keyboard and interested I may
write a documentation on this keyboard.

The kmd3 or adapter box is not necessary. But if you have one, you can switch
keyboard and mouse input between 2 computers on the keyboard.ï»¿

### Videos

* Using kmd3. Quick demo, types on computer. Includes Set-up and macro definition. 
Cherry G80-9039HAAUS / Reuters AK124. 2 cables coming off the rear: 
    a) 15? pin D connector to another 15 pin D, attached to the keyboard at 
    about theater is a thick, black cable
    coming from a black "brick". (Power supply??) Labeled with a paper sticker saying 
    "REUTERS EQUIPMENT." This seems likely where the keyboard is being powered from.
    b) Thin cable DB-9 likely, adjacent to 1st cable. Enters the keyboard at approximately
    the F20 key location.
