![Calculator mode keys](../master/images/Cherry%20G80-9009%20Calculator%20mode%20keys.png "Calculator mode keys")

It's a floating-point calculator. Largest representable number seems to be 9.000 E+1000.

Has eight memories, ```√⎺```, percent, etc. functions.

Enter Calc mode with the Calc key. Exit with either "Desk PC" or Wkst" keys.

Calc, Num Lock and Caps Lock LEDs are illuminated in Calc mode, and cannot be turned off .

* Number keys, both sets, both decimal points, +, -, /, and = all work as expected.
* Backspace deletes the most eecent digit entered. 1,2,3, Backspace, Backspace yields "1."
* Clear clears the current calculation, but not memories.
* Delete clears the current (pending) operation and entry.
* Reset clears the current entry, calculation, and memories. It does not change the decimal setting.
* Both Enter keys are used for "=". "=" without another operation and number
repeats the last operation. Example: 1 * 2 = is 2. =, =, = makes 16.
* Reset key (red) clears the current entry, calculation, and **all** 8 memories. It does not change the decimal setting.
24 24 24* Pressing either Control key clears the display of the Calc F1-F12 keys, but seems to have no other effect.
* Arrow keys (Left/Right) are only used to set number of decimals, while in setup mode.
* F1-F12 function keys are used for

EXP is used for entering 10 to the X scaling. Example: 1 3 EXP 2 = 1300.
Negative exponents can be entered as well: 1 3 EXP 4 5 +/- = 1.3E-044
