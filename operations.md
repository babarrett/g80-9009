Enter Calc mode with the Calc key. Exit with either "Desk PC" or Wkst" keys.

Num Lock and Caps Lock are illuminated and cannot be turned off in Calc mode.

* Number keys, both sets, both decimal points, +, -, /, and = all work as expected.
* Backspace deletes the most eecent digit entered. 1,2,3, Backspace, Backspace yields "1."
* Clear clears the current calculation, but not memories.
* Delete clears the current (pending) operation and entry.
* Reset clears the current entry, calculation, and memories. It does not change the decimal setting.
* Both Enter keys are used for "=". "=" without another operation and number
repeats the last operation. Example: 1 * 2 = is 2. =, =, = makes 16.

Shift changes:
    * Shift+F1  -> Setup. Allows changing of decimals from 0 to 8 places.
    Left/Right arrow to change. Either Enter key to set and exit.
    * Shift+F11 -> M up.  Select a memory form 1 to 8
    * Shift+F12 -> M down Select a memory form 8 to 1

Arrow keys (Left/Right) are only used to set number of decimals, while in setup mode.

Control keys change the Calc display (clear th Fn key legends) but seem to have no other effect.

## Macro setup & use.

The Control keys display the Control+F1 to Control+F12 macro legends.
The Shift keys display the Shift+F1 to Shift+F12 macro legends.
Either Enter key can be used for programming macros.
